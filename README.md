# Q-Learning-Agent-Play-Frozen-Lake

Code to enable us to watch our own trained Q-learning agent play Frozen Lake. Our agent has to navigate the grid by staying on the frozen surface without falling into any holes until it reaches the frisbee. If it reaches the frisbee, it wins with a reward of plus one. If it falls in a hole, it loses and receives no points for the entire episode.
